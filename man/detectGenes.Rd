\alias{detectGenes}
\title{Sets the global expression detection threshold to be used with this CellDataSet.
Counts how many cells each feature in a CellDataSet object that are detectably expressed
above a minimum threshold. Also counts the number of genes above this threshold are
detectable in each cell.}
\usage{
detectGenes(cds, min_expr = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{the CellDataSet upon which to perform this operation}

\item{min_expr}{the expression threshold}
}
\value{
an updated CellDataSet object
}
\description{
Sets the global expression detection threshold to be used with this CellDataSet.
Counts how many cells each feature in a CellDataSet object that are detectably expressed
above a minimum threshold. Also counts the number of genes above this threshold are
detectable in each cell.
