\title{Get the weights needed to lift cells back to high dimensional expression space.}
\usage{
reducedDimA(cds)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{A CellDataSet object.}
}
\value{
A matrix that when multiplied by a reduced-dimension set of coordinates for the CellDataSet,
recovers a matrix in the full (whitened) space
}
\description{
Retrieves the weights that transform the cells' coordinates in the reduced
dimension space back to the full (whitened) space.

data(HSMM)
A <- reducedDimA(HSMM)
}
