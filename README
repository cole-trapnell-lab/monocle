MONOCLE 0.99.6
=======================

This is a BETA release of the Monocle analysis toolkit for
single-cell RNA-Seq experiments.  To use this package, you 
will need the R statistical computing environment (version 3.0 or later)
and several packages available through Bioconductor and CRAN.

This package is in the BETA stage of development, meaning
features will continue to be added, though we will try to keep interfaces as 
consistent as possible as new versions are released.  

Updates to Monocle will be distributed through the Monocle website at:

http://monocle-bio.sourceforge.net

This release supports Mac OS X and Linux. Windows may support this 
build, but Monocle has not been tested on Windows yet.
